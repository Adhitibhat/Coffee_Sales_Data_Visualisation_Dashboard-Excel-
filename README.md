# Coffee_Sales_Data_Visualisation_Dashboard-Excel
### About he Dataset
This dataset serves as a cornerstone for managing and analyzing the operations of a coffee business. It encompasses three primary datasets: Orders, Customers, and Products, each contributing valuable insights into the company's performance and customer interactions.

### Description
In this Excel mini dashboard project, I integrated three distinct datasets: Customers, Product, and Order details, to create a comprehensive and user-friendly data visualization tool. The project encompasses a series of data gathering and processing steps, leveraging advanced Excel functions and techniques.

#### 1. Data Gathering:
a) IF Statements: Employed IF statements to conditionally execute specific actions based on predefined criteria. This may involve handling exceptions or creating dynamic data representations.

b) VLOOKUPs: Integrated VLOOKUP functions to establish relationships between datasets, allowing for efficient retrieval of information across different sheets or tables.

c) INDEX Functions: Leveraged INDEX functions to locate and retrieve specific data points within the datasets, contributing to a more flexible and dynamic data structure.

#### 2. Data Processing:

a) Conditional Formatting: Applied conditional formatting to enhance data visualization and interpretation. This likely involved formatting cells based on data types, ranges, or specific conditions, making it easier for users to identify trends, outliers, or key information.

b)Data Type Standardization: Ensured consistency in data types across the datasets. This standardization facilitates a more uniform representation of information, minimizing errors and improving overall data quality.

#### 3. Dashboard Design:

-Organized and structured the gathered and processed data to create an intuitive dashboard layout.

-Implemented visual elements, such as charts, graphs, or tables, to present key insights and trends in a visually appealing manner.

-User-Friendly Interface: Designed the dashboard with the end user in mind, aiming for simplicity and ease of navigation.

Overall, this Excel mini dashboard project showcases proficiency in data manipulation, formula application, and data visualization techniques, contributing to a valuable tool for analyzing and interpreting complex datasets.
